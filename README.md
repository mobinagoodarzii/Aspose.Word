This class provides a method to create a new Word document:
- It utilizes the `Document` class constructor to initialize a new document object.
- It creates a `DocumentBuilder` object to facilitate content addition to the document.
- The `DocumentBuilder`'s `writeln` method is used to add sample content to the document.
- Finally, the `save` method of the `Document` class is called to save the document in the DOCX format at the specified path.

### Document Editor Class

The `FontChecker` class contains two static methods:
1. `isFontInstalled(String fontName)`: Checks if a font with the specified name is installed on the system and returns a boolean value.
2. `installFont(String fontFilePath)`: Installs a custom font from the specified file path into the system (TTF format) if it's not already installed.

## Challenges
- **Limited Free Features**: Aspose.Words imposes restrictions on free usage, including the insertion of a message stating "Created with an evaluation copy of Aspose.Words" in documents generated with the evaluation version.
- **Lack of Extensive Learning Resources**: There is a shortage of comprehensive tutorials and examples for Aspose.Words, necessitating users to primarily rely on official documentation.
- **Alternative Solution**: Apache POI is a popular open-source alternative to Aspose.Words, offering similar functionality for working with Microsoft Office documents in Java, along with extensive documentation and community support.
